00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Brother, may I have some oats?

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.320
No.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
I am starving, brother.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.960
As in, I, brother.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.160
The tall skinny figure has thrown the oats at me.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.960
Me, brother.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.400
I believe they have taken a liking to me.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400
No, brother.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.679
I have seen this before.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:24.600
I have observed many things.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.960
But the roaring beast let the tall skinny figures crawl inside of the travel far beyond

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.079
the horizon to how the figure weeped when the other had fallen into a deep sleep.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.560
And from my experiences, I have learned that they will give extra oats to one of us

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.079
before taking them into the shade of no return.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.799
They will do terrible things in that shade, brother.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:52.799
Lies.

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:58.560
That shade is where that chosen ones go to dine with our tall skinny gods.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.800
You are a fool, brother.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.640
And you shall be left behind in the mud with your backwards ideas.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.040
No, brother.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.640
You must believe me.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.439
Share with me the oats and you shall not reach the desired girth for the tall skinny ones.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.599
They will spare your life, brother.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:16.599
Aha!

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.240
So this was all a plan to steal my oats.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.640
You truly are this pickable, brother.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.079
I will not trust your lies.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.840
Brother, when they took me outside the reaches of the pointy fences into the roaring beast

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.840
and way over the horizon, I saw it.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.679
I was taken to a gathering of these tall skinny figures.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.519
They paraded me around, brother, and I saw the truth.

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:48.239
I saw the tall skinny ones consuming our flesh.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.480
I could not have been mistaken, brother.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.000
The smell of the flesh was surely one of us.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.400
I spinted the flesh above a fire, let it burn before consuming it.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.640
They did not just consume it either, brother.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.640
They took pleasure from this.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.039
The mouth curved a wicked smile, and even let out bones of satisfaction from consuming

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.599
our flesh, brother.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.520
The figures are consumers, brother.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.400
They are no different than the furry red demon that consumed and terrorized us in the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.000
feathered ones.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.680
Your story amuses me, brother, but it's not convinced me.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.120
I shall have these alpes myself and die in with the tall skinny gods.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.800
I am sorry for you, brother.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.599
Your eyes cannot take the blinding light of the truth, and you scurry back to your cave.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.840
I shall take care of your spawn once they consume you, brother, as they have consumed

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.480
your lover, our father, our mother, and many more.
