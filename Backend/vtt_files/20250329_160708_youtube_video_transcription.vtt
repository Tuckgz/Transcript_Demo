OH BABY A TRIPLE

00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:04.000
NUMBER 2

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.399
Hi, this video is on 6-3 stacking, 5-4 stacking and centerwell stacking in general

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:12.399
but before I start, according to youtube statistics, nobody is subscribed to my channel

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:17.440
so if you end up liking this video, consider being my first. It's free and you can always subscribe. Enjoy the video.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.840
So to start off, the reason why this isn't called anything like 75 stacking is because

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.559
in the name 6-3 stack, the 6 refers to the 6 columns from the left side

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:31.440
and the 3 refers to the 3 columns from the right side

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.520
so if you had something like a 7-2 stack, you'd have 7 columns from the left side

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.560
and 2 columns from the right

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.639
if you had a 2-7 stack, you'd have 2 columns from the left side and then 7 columns from the right

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:44.000
and that's why we call it a 9-0 stack which is the one you should be familiar with

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.119
you have 9 columns from the left side and 0 columns from the right side

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:48.159
because that's where the well is

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.840
I think it's pretty commonly agreed that the best wells for stacking in versus tetris

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.439
are 6-3 or 5-4 because they allow for easy T-spin setups

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.400
now I won't be getting into T-spin setups yet, but here's how you can center well stack for sprint

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.800
so starting off with the right side of our stack

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.040
you just have to think back to the stacking patterns episode

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.959
where we looked at the 3x4 boxes

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:11.919
and honestly, it really just is a bunch of 3x4 boxes

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:13.839
so this here is a 3x4 box

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.599
this here is going to be another 3x4 box

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.639
this here is going to be another 3x4 box

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:19.519
and it just continues

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.760
so the right side is really simple

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.559
I'm also going to add on some 3x4 boxes that you might not know already

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:25.519
so this is the first one

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.080
and this is the second one

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:33.599
so J-J-O or L-L-O will also create a 3x4 box

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.440
now building the left side is a lot more difficult

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.879
and it really just is a bunch of lookahead

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:39.360
but I'll try my best to give you some pointers so you can get through this

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.599
first things first

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:46.319
the right side is always going to be a combination of J-L-Z-S or O

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.160
and so the only pieces that I didn't mention were the T and the I piece

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.279
and so those pieces are always going to be on the left side column

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.319
but if you do accidentally put a T on that other side

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.680
you need to make sure that you have a second T to put on that side

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.839
in order to keep on doing the 3x4 patterns

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:05.120
you won't be able to do 3x4 patterns if you only have one T on the other side

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.879
so stick with an even number of Ts

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.399
the second thing to keep in mind is that the hardest pieces to place

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.639
are definitely going to be those S and Z pieces

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.199
so make sure that you always have a place to put them

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.080
and really pay attention to especially those pieces in the queue

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.240
these are some patterns to get rid of the S and Z pieces

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.759
and most of these will just be refreshes

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.119
this first one is the most important one

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.360
if you have any part of your stack that is of a T shape

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.559
this essentially is a stair that's coming from the left side and the right side

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.279
so it can fit the S and the Z piece on the back of it

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.839
similarly if you have any part of your stack that has a T-shaped hole

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:36.960
you can think of it the same way

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.559
one of the stairs goes up to the right

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.839
one of the stairs goes up to the left

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.520
so you can lodge both of them onto it

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.080
the second pattern is when there are stairs that are two blocks apart

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.119
and you can go like this

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.720
and when they are together you can do this

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.839
next if you have flat ground but there's a hole inside

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.440
you can use the S and Z piece like this

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.880
and finally if you have one stair that has nothing next to it

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.479
you can lodge them onto each other like this

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.679
all these patterns will be extremely useful for dealing with these S and Z pieces

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.479
this is another method you can try to do 6-3 with

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.440
so what we're going to do is we're going to sort each column into different groups

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.559
the first four columns we're going to use the T, S and Z piece

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.279
the right three columns we're just going to make the 3x4 boxes

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.919
and the middle two columns we just use the linear pieces which are the I, O, J, L

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.320
and we just create 2xX boxes with them

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.600
so it looks something a bit like this

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:29.600
so

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.880
and yeah you get the point it just continues

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.399
to be honest I'm not sure why I haven't seen many people main this but it works

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.320
so if you want to use it, it works

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.399
and in my opinion this is the best opener for 6-3

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.039
and inside of that fifth column we're just going to put the second I piece

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.160
with 5-4 stacking it's a lot less systematic

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.039
as you can see in my stack any piece can literally go anywhere

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.479
but here are my tips to try and help you

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.199
firstly remember those 3x4 boxes?

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.639
well get ready for Harry Houdini

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.320
4x3 box

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.279
it's the exact same thing

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:13.520
so on the 4 side remember your 4-3 boxes

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.440
also the S, Z patterns that we used in 6-3 stacking are also applicable on the 4 column

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.559
secondly it's only okay for one side of your stack to be spiky

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.160
if both sides are spiky you're dead

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.640
unlucky

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.040
go next

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.559
thirdly getting rid of a spiky stack should be in the same tier of dependencies

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.799
in that you need to get rid of them as soon as possible

00:04:28.799 --> 00:04:30.320
so here's an I dependency

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.000
and here we're fixing a spike

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.200
I don't want to see any shenanigans done until those two conditions are met

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.399
and here we're pretty much finished

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:37.359
so thanks for watching

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:37.679
thank you

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:44.959
bye
